# 07 - forwarRef

## Background
String refs are problematic for async react (performance wise), and string refs
are generally not very react'ish, since they are indirect.

You need to add it on dom element.
```
<input ref={'inputRef'} />
```

And suddenly you have access to it on `this.refs.inputRef`, this means indirect
since there is no direct way for us to know what happens, we never saw it happens.

### Callbacks refs

We are grabbing new input node and directly saving it where we want. Hence, direct.

1. React needs it for async mode
2. Gets rid of indirection


### createRef

```
<input ref={node => this.inputRef = node} />
```
